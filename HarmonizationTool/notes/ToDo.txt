A13 ISSUE:  What does Commit mean?  How is a user supposed to know that Commit is starting to 
  form some sort of structure by which to search through?  I don't know what it even means to commit.
  SOLN: Document to the user that before "Commit" nothing in the TDB changes and if they quit and return, they will have to start over.

A14 BUG:  Haha!  If I close the CSV file (step 7) the match flowables thing keeps running 
   0/445  0/446  0/447...
  SOLN: Make "Cancel" quit the other thread.

A15 BUG:  Can't stop a commit part of the way through it
  SOLN: Make it possible to "Cancel" the commit (see A14)
  
A17 FEATURE REQUEST:  What are "issues"  - designate them
  SOLN: Document this.  Eventually add new issues with or without auto-resolve.

A19 BUG: Allow for deletion of data set... can make infinitely many 
  ... and ISSUE:  Every time a particular data set is loaded (for example: test.csv) the tool will
  load test_1 then test_2 then test_3 etc etc... It's not really clear why this happens.

  SOLN: 1) Make delete easier (confirm)
        2) Delete the data
        3) When you read a new file and assign to existing data set, don't create new data set!
    
A22 BUG: File read and data process speeds must be faster
  SOLN: Better data management.  At a minimum, users must be notified prior to slow processes
  
A23 BUG: Match flowables doesn't work (no commit / assign)
  SOLN:  complete match flowable functionality including the following: CHRIS work here vvv
         1) UI design features that allow the user to annotate each of the match candidates as
            a) same (=)
            b) subset (subset symbol)
            c) superset (superset symbol)
            d) proxy (~, or double squiggle equal sign)
            e) explicit non-equal (not equal symbol)
         2) NEW window allowing user to search (or perhaps a blank row with text entry fields for searching
         3) If time, a way to establish the criteria under which a candidate should be accepted as same (e.g. If name and cas match, but name does not match other flowables)
         4) UI feature that tells user the status of each row / flowable
         5) UI design so that user can change assignments
 NOTE: Still working on this - stay tuned.  May come back with some questions tomorrow after work...
         
  
A24 BUG: Transaction work not complete.
    SOLN:  Fix them, but ideally create larger, more efficient transactions
        STATUS: Added to ActiveTDB two versions of each routine that writes to the TDB:
        Regular and transaction safe (ts)
        Changed all calls to use the transaction safe ones.  There seem to be a glitch in AutoMatch so that
        Flowable name does not get assigned...  fix this, then move ahead 

A25 FEATURE REQUEST: Allow for sorting of issues and 'tagged rows' to top of CSV table.  No sorting options = sad day.  

A27 BUG: Remove the Logger WARN, INFO, etc..

A28 BUG: When closing a CSV file, the Match flowables tool as well as match contexts tool and match properties tool remains populated.
    SOLN: Add methods to reset these, then call it when a CSV file is closed

A30 BUG: Both primary and additional contexts don't show up, only primary context (in the Match Context Tool)


#=========================================================================
#=========  USER INTERFACE CHANGE REQUESTS ===============================
#=========================================================================

U2: When clicking a row to ignore, the "yellow" of that column disappears temporarily 
Which makes it confusing to see what row you are actually wanting to ignore.  It is as if when clicking the row you want to ignore the error disappears on you.

U3: TAGGED concept: Allow the user to select a row and "tag it" and sort by
All tagged rows.  

U5: Add changes from flowWorkflowUI.png

U6: Add changes from ToolUI.png

U8: Under Query Properties/Context Tools, have primary in regular text and additional in parenthesis.

U9: Switch the second and third columns.

U10: What does Auto Advance checkbox do??

U11: Always have Flows Workflow, Match Flowables Tool, Match Properties Tool, and Match Context Tool on the LHS of the application screen.  Always have the CSVTable show up on the RHS of the application screen.

U12: All other windows other than those mentioned in U11 should open at the bottom of the window (which I think primary is the SPARQL windows and logger).  

U13: What does Commit Matches do?  Does it actually commit or are we already committing when the 'match' shows up in the matched window under the Match Properties and Match Contexts Tools?

U14: Still not sure about what to do to navigate the use through the annotation windows other than to grey out impossible options.  This will require us to actually 
Think about the logic but I think we need to start there... See below for ideas...

#====================
CHANGE CSVTable UI: 

  1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5                 (grey out impossible options)
                                                  
 1 | 2 | 3 | Flowable Field | 5     (grey out impossible options)

 1 | Context Field | 3 | Flowable Field | 5 (grey out impossible options)

 Whatever your rules are - indicate to the user the steps for assigning these
  things.  

Guide me!  :)

U15 FEATURE REQUEST - Remove Auto Advance button from MatchContext and MatchProperty tools and make that the default

B1  FEATURE REQUEST / ISSUE: Help File? Help tab? This could be one of the biggest and most important things to 
  implement before Oct 1... If we write this file, we will definitely come across more bugs.
  Honestly, I don't remember how to get started on using this tool, so maybe we should start 
  with the help file... documentation or w/e we need to get the user going.   Perhaps some
  introductory dialogue boxes upon first startup
  SOLN: Provide some kind of help somewhere, really!

B2 ISSUE: No README.TXT file in the installation directory 
  SOLN: Provide some kind of help somewhere, really!

B3 ISSUE: The zipped file is completely non-descript... "win64.zip" isn't useful information. 
  Instead, use something like "LCA_Harmonization_v1.8.zip" with a win64 subdirectory
  SOLN: Better name for zip file and better name for the folders that it produces

B4 ISSUE: Under 'SPARQL' -> 'Show Query View' the 'Run Query' and 'Update Query' buttons look
  poorly positioned
  SOLN: Check position in Win8 and Win7

B5 ISSUE: 'SPARQL' -> 'Show Query View' -> dbl 'Show CAS Matches' shouldn't error out as 
  "'Query' has encountered a problem.", instead notify the user that there are no CAS's to
  match (when no data input)
  SOLN: Deprecate most buttons, decide the value of others

B6 ISSUE: 'SPARQL' -> 'Show Query View' -> dbl 'Show CAS and Name Matches' shouldn't error out as 
  "'Query' has encountered a problem.", instead notify the user that there are no CAS's or 
  Names to match (when no data input)
  SOLN: Deprecate most buttons, decide the value of others

B7 BUG: 'SPARQL' -> 'Show Query View' -> dbl 'Harmonize Compartments' if I hit the X button on
  the dialogue box that appears, the entire Query panel dissapears.  This does not happen with
  any other button in the Query panel
  SOLN: Deprecate most buttons, decide the value of others

B8 FEATURE REQUEST: Unique icons for different functionality in the tool
  SOLN: Figure out how to get built-in (eclipse or RCP) icons and use them.  Try to match with OpenLCA icons
  NOTE: harmonization.product in the Branding tab

B9 BUG: No check mark or any indication that a window is shown under 'Window Manager'
  SOLN: Change menu in Harmoniation Tool (Manifest) extensions and make the handler toggle

B10 FEATURE REQUEST: In the 'Match Flowables' panel, show an index for the row as well as the
  rank (in mouse over info, perhaps)
  SOLN: Unnecessary, Tom thinks.

B11 ISSUE: The Harmonization tool icon in the install directory should not have the same icon as
  eclipse
  SOLN: Pick a few icons, let PI decide how much effort to put into this.

B12 FEATURE REQUEST: Add working directory in application window border
  SOLN: Just add it

B13 FEATURE REQUEST:  Designate sections of checking data and loading data vs. an actual search
  SOLN: Consider phases with sections for the workflow. Add "Step" above the steps, and "Phase" above the phases

B14 FEATURE REQUEST:  Allow for "un-commit" - removing things from TDB after commit
  SOLN: Shouldn't be too hard, but requires a little thought

B15 BUG:  Change color of "fixed stuff" to something different than green
  SOLN: Avoid use of color in general (though gray is nice, don't you think?).  GET ICONS

B16 FEATURE REQUEST:  If we know that our data has some junk in it, ignore some of the errors
  SOLN: Add a column action for "ignore remaining issues".  This means keep the row, but substitute bad text for "" (empty string).

B17 FEATURE REQUEST:  Somehow reorganize the green/yellow selecting things... 
  SOLN: Create "jump to next" or (better) add a toggle function "show only issue rows"

B18 When I load in my data for the first time, assuming I don't know to assign any columns, I will
  immediately hit Check Data.  Fortunately, you already tell the person to assign a column, but 
  that is not obvious from the UI.  There needs to be a visual queue to tell the user to assign those
  columns and the rules for how to assign them. Again, this goes back to the readme thing...but maybe
  we're holding off on that...  In the mean time, add some wording above the column assignment
  that directs the user to assign the information where those blank dashes are.  Also, instead of 
  using dashes, have the steps triggered in the headers...
  SOLN: Disable "Check Data" until at least one column is assigned

B19 Why allow people to even look at a 'standardize CAS' option if CAS hasn't even been assigned... 
  What if I didn't even include CAS.  Remove functionalities that are impossible.  
  ... and  Issue: Some functionalities shouldn't show up if they aren't possible.  For example, auto-resolve
  CAS shouldn't show up if that field has not been assigned a CAS.  Also, auto-resolve field shouldn't
  be possible if the data hasn't been checked via the Check Data button (2).

 SOLN: Change menu options to include only possible ones

B22 (copied from A3)
  FEATURE REQUEST:  Startup allows user to choose project directory
  SOLN: Have user select a working directory
      include a checkbox: use as default working directory and do not show this dialogue box again

B23 (was A18) BUG:  CASRN should be CAS, Name should be Flowable name in results
  Synonyms should be Flowable Synonyms 
  SOLN: Standardize words, names, etc.  Some of this should be on the object level: avoid duplicating strings in the code.
  STATUS: Used a hack to standardize.  Works for now.
  NEXT: Carefully develop the CSVColumnInfo model so that properties of objects can be defined generally

B24 (was A20) FEATURE REQUEST: Need to be able to match Flow Contexts
  SOLN: Finish reconnecting old interface to new data structure
  STATUS: Done.
  NEXT: New suggestions welcome. CHRIS consider simplest UI changes, then consider separating pop. density
        Also, consider UI design so that user can change assignments
  
B25 (was A21) FEATURE REQUEST: Need to be able to match Flow Properties
  SOLN: Connecting to new data structure
  STATUS: Done.
  NEXT: New suggestions welcome.  CHRIS consider simplest UI changes and perhaps grouping of units
        Also, consider UI design so that user can change assignments

B26 FEATURE REQUEST: Middle mouse button scroll.

B27 FEATURE REQUEST: Allow user to save columns which are not otherwise assigned:
                     1) User selects a pull down: "user defined field"
                     2) User chooses data type (string, float, int, etc.)
                        a) Ideally the tool would parse the column looking for invalid data
                        b) If not, the data could be stored as strings?!?
                     3) User assigns field name
                     4) HT adds triples like
                     _:b0 a lcaht:UserDefinedDataField .
                     _:b0 lcaht:validValueRange xsd:string .
                     _:b0 eco:hasDataSource [the data source] .
                     _:b1 a lcaht:UserDefinedEntry .
                     _:b1 lcaht:hasUserDefinedName "Super important data that I don't want to lose" .
                     _:b1 lcaht:hasUserDefinedValue "42 lbs." .
                     _:b1 fedlca.sourceTableRowNumber 33^^xsd:integer .
                     _:b1 lcaht:hasDataField _:b0 .


B28 (was A2)  BUG: If you try to open two instances of the application, the issue of selecting a TDB will occur.  Only way
  out of it is to go to Task Manager and manually close the application
  SOLN:  You can't open two at the same time?!?
  STATUS: Probably platform dependent.  On Mac 64bit, trying a second time just puts focus on first instance.  Test on Windows and document issues.
  UPDATE (from Chris): As of 9:14 - opening a second instance requires that a second TDB be created which is okay.  The next thing to do is to allow the
         creation of new project files and TDB files so that a second instance can be opened if desired.  In short the dialogue box for all of the paths needs
         to allow files to be created.                     


B29 (was A12) ISSUE: Some windows don't have vertical scrollbars which could be helpful depending on the
  size of the window
  SOLN: For QueryView, make auto scroll in both directions (but don't spend too much time on QueryView)
  STATUS: Got the query view to fill, but no scroll bars and all on one line (at least in Windows)
  NEXT: Try again to get this right.
  NEXT: Chris document which others.
  UPDATE (from Chris): Okay so under the SPARQL Query view, if you drag the window up you can eventually see the left-right scroll for the left panel that contains
         "show data sets" "Show DataSet Contents" etc... the issue is that when this window is small, the scroll bar doesn't show up.  Also, when the window is small the
         vertical scrollbar still doesn't show up for the actual SPARQL Query window (the yellow background with the query text).  
         
B30 FEATURE REQUEST - Make the default Data Source name increment as follows file.csv -> file ... then file.csv -> file(1) ... then file.csv -> file(2) ... and so on

C1 FEATURE REQUEST:  The 'Match Flowables' panel is completely uncustomizable.  I would want to
  be able to view my data in whatever way I want.  I should at least be able to center the 
  headers in the columns and reorganize the headers to have CASRN first or Synonyms first or 
  w/e... 
  SOLN: Do nothing.  The query can be changed for different output configuration.  Style doesn't matter.

C2 BUG: The border for a lot of windows are interrupted by the minimize and maximize buttons
  SOLN: Consider turning off access to some buttons?!?

C3 BUG: The empty CSV table whitespace doesn't extend the whole window for some reason.
  SOLN: Fix resizing

C4 QUESTION: The TDB files created are messy, shouldn't they be buried a litle bit so the user
  doesn't have to stare at them?
  SOLN: Now in separate folder.  Tell user they don't have to look there.
  
C5 ISSUE: Can hide all of a column when the name should still appear
  SOLN: Perhaps find a minimum size based on text or something - or defined min. for each View

C6 QUESTION:  Should the CSV Table panel give an indication of what imported data is expected?
  I honestly don't what what data I should be giving the thing...
  SOLN: Consider adding info about the Workflow in the workflow window (a tooltip, maybe)
 
C7 ISSUE: Can I only import a CSV or can I import an xls or xlsx file?
  SOLN: No Excel now.  Later? Yes!

C8 QUESTION:  What format should my input file be in?  How will I know if I imported garbage?
  SOLN: Do nothing new.  Garbage data is user's problem

C9 FEATURE REQUEST:  Automatically detect row 1 for column headers
  SOLN: Maybe later.  It would only be a suggestion, and the user could change it.

C10 FEATURE REQUEST:  A dialogue box or something that explains how a search is run and what is required
  SOLN: Document and eventually allow user input for criteria for match

C11 FEATURE REQUEST: Instantiate:  Flowable Resource Object With Name / Synonym (FROWNS) :-(
  SOLN: The world is ready for FROWNS
 
C12 FEATURE REQUEST: Instantiate:  Data Unique meta-block system (DUMBS) %^{
  SOLN: The world is ready for DUMBS
  
C13 FEATURE REQUEST:  Minimize std.err std.out output file 
  SOLN: See if there is a way to do this systematically instead of removing every freaking System.out.println("") line!

C14 Need a save button - need something to keep these preferences... Is the log supposed to 
   do this?
  SOLN: Make a system of logging (to tell what happened), and a re-run script created during user run.

A1  BUG: Can't get out of selecting a TDB on install.  An infinite loop of dialogue boxes occurs
  SOLN:  Just fix it.
  STATUS: Done? Now that a default TDB exists on startup, the only option is to change it in preferences, but there *seems* to be no infinite loop
    
A4  ISSUE: No way to tell what version the Harmonization Tool is inside the program (about Harmonization Tool)
  SOLN: Indicate version number (in Help -> About... pull down?!?)
  STATUS: DONE
  
A5  BUG: When "Saving Results" with no input, nothing happens

  STATUS: Done.  Message appears if the SPARQL Results window is not open or does not contain results.  If cancel pressed, tool behaves.

A6  FEATURE REQUEST: Set some standard perspectives for people to choose from 
  SOLN: Make the menu item do SOMETHING.
  STATUS: "Perspective switcher" cycles through three "sample" perspectives
  NEXT: Decide what perspectives the user might want.  Also restore views necessary to perspectives.
  NOTE: Look in gov.epa.nrmrl.std.lca.ht.harmonizationtool -> ApplicationWorkbenchWindowAdvisor line 33 for startup size
 
A7  BUG: When selecting 'Window Manager' -> 'Work Flows' -> 'Show Perspectives' with no file
  loaded, nothing happens
  SOLN: Critical: allow restore original perspective.  Desired (later): save your favorite perspective(s)
  STATUS: Done for now.  See A6

A8  ISSUE (document):Can right click the Query window and import an .rq file
  SOLN: Document this
