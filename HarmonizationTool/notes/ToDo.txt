A2  BUG: If you try to open two instances of the application, the issue of selecting a TDB will occur.  Only way
  out of it is to go to Task Manager and manually close the application
  SOLN:  You can't open two at the same time?!?
  STATUS: Probably platform dependent.  On Mac 64bit, trying a second time just puts focus on first instance.  Test on Windows and document issues.

A8  ISSUE (document):Can right click the Query window and import an .rq file
  SOLN: Document this
  STATUS: I think this is gone
  NEXT: Confirm current status, please.  Determine if it is desired....

A12 ISSUE: Some windows don't have vertical scrollbars which could be helpful depending on the
  size of the window
  SOLN: For QueryView, make auto scroll in both directions (but don't spend too much time on QueryView)
  NEXT: Chris document which others.

A13 ISSUE:  What does Commit mean?  How is a user supposed to know that Commit is starting to 
  form some sort of structure by which to search through?  I don't know what it even means
  to commit.
  SOLN: Document to the user that before "Commit" nothing in the TDB changes and if they quit and return, they will have to start over.

A14 BUG:  Haha!  If I close the CSV file (step 7) the match flowables thing keeps running 
   0/445  0/446  0/447...
  SOLN: Make "Cancel" quit the other thread.

A15 BUG:  Can't stop a commit part of the way through it
  SOLN: Make it possible to "Cancel" the commit (see A14)

 #====================
A16 CHANGE UI:
  1. Assign Flowable Field

  Assign | Assign | Assign | Assign | Assign      where Assign means to assign a flowable field
  SOLN: Add "step 2" without button, but with status of which components have been assigned and whether
        the required fields are assigned yet (minimum requirements)
        Chris will figure it out ;^)
 

                                                  (grey out everything but flowable field)

  If flowable field has been assigned, 

  2. Assign Context Field 

  assign | assign | assign | Flowable Field | assign     where assign means to assign a context field
                                                         (grey out flowable field or whatever)
  You can see that I have assigned the 4th thing to the flowable field, but now assign 
  means that the others need to be assigned a context field.  

  3. assign | Context Field | assign | Flowable Field | assign .... 

  You get the idea.  Whatever your rules are - indicate to the user the steps for assigning these
  things.  I might forget every other time how to assign this data - or if I don't use this tool
  but once every few months, I'm going to forget the procedure.  Guide me!  :)
 #====================
  
A17 FEATURE REQUEST:  What are "issues"  - designate them
  SOLN: Document this.  Eventually add new issues with or without auto-resolve.

A19 BUG: Allow for deletion of data set... can make infinitely many 
  ... and ISSUE:  Every time a particular data set is loaded (for example: test.csv) the tool will
  load test_1 then test_2 then test_3 etc etc... It's not really clear why this happens.

  SOLN: 1) Make delete easier (confirm)
        2) Delete the data
        3) When you read a new file and assign to existing data set, don't create new data set!
    
A22 BUG: File read and data process speeds must be faster
  SOLN: Better data management.  At a minimum, users must be notified prior to slow processes
  
A23 BUG: Match flowables doesn't work (no commit / assign)
  SOLN:  complete match flowable functionality

B1  FEATURE REQUEST / ISSUE: Help File? Help tab? This could be one of the biggest and most important things to 
  implement before Oct 1... If we write this file, we will definitely come across more bugs.
  Honestly, I don't remember how to get started on using this tool, so maybe we should start 
  with the help file... documentation or w/e we need to get the user going.   Perhaps some
  introductory dialogue boxes upon first startup
  SOLN: Provide some kind of help somewhere, really!

B2 ISSUE: No README.TXT file in the installation directory 
  SOLN: Provide some kind of help somewhere, really!

B3 ISSUE: The zipped file is completely non-descript... "win64.zip" isn't useful information. 
  Instead, use something like "LCA_Harmonization_v1.8.zip" with a win64 subdirectory
  SOLN: Better name for zip file and better name for the folders that it produces

B4 ISSUE: Under 'SPARQL' -> 'Show Query View' the 'Run Query' and 'Update Query' buttons look
  poorly positioned
  SOLN: Check position in Win8 and Win7

B5 ISSUE: 'SPARQL' -> 'Show Query View' -> dbl 'Show CAS Matches' shouldn't error out as 
  "'Query' has encountered a problem.", instead notify the user that there are no CAS's to
  match (when no data input)
  SOLN: Deprecate most buttons, decide the value of others

B6 ISSUE: 'SPARQL' -> 'Show Query View' -> dbl 'Show CAS and Name Matches' shouldn't error out as 
  "'Query' has encountered a problem.", instead notify the user that there are no CAS's or 
  Names to match (when no data input)
  SOLN: Deprecate most buttons, decide the value of others

B7 BUG: 'SPARQL' -> 'Show Query View' -> dbl 'Harmonize Compartments' if I hit the X button on
  the dialogue box that appears, the entire Query panel dissapears.  This does not happen with
  any other button in the Query panel
  SOLN: Deprecate most buttons, decide the value of others

B8 FEATURE REQUEST: Unique icons for different functionality in the tool
  SOLN: Figure out how to get built-in (eclipse or RCP) icons and use them.  Try to match with OpenLCA icons
  NOTE: harmonization.product in the Branding tab

B9 BUG: No check mark or any indication that a window is shown under 'Window Manager'
  SOLN: Change menu in Harmoniation Tool (Manifest) extensions and make the handler toggle

B10 FEATURE REQUEST: In the 'Match Flowables' panel, show an index for the row as well as the
  rank (in mouse over info, perhaps)
  SOLN: Unnecessary, Tom thinks.

B11 ISSUE: The Harmonization tool icon in the install directory should not have the same icon as
  eclipse
  SOLN: Pick a few icons, let PI decide how much effort to put into this.

B12 FEATURE REQUEST: Add working directory in application window border
  SOLN: Just add it

B13 FEATURE REQUEST:  Designate sections of checking data and loading data vs. an actual search
  SOLN: Consider phases with sections for the workflow. Add "Step" above the steps, and "Phase" above the phases

B14 FEATURE REQUEST:  Allow for "un-commit" - removing things from TDB after commit
  SOLN: Shouldn't be too hard, but requires a little thought

B15 BUG:  Change color of "fixed stuff" to something different than green
  SOLN: Avoid use of color in general (though gray is nice, don't you think?).  GET ICONS

B16 FEATURE REQUEST:  If we know that our data has some junk in it, ignore some of the errors
  SOLN: Add a column action for "ignore remaining issues".  This means keep the row, but substitute bad text for "" (empty string).

B17 FEATURE REQUEST:  Somehow reorganize the green/yellow selecting things... 
  SOLN: Create "jump to next" or (better) add a toggle function "show only issue rows"

B18 When I load in my data for the first time, assuming I don't know to assign any columns, I will
  immediately hit Check Data.  Fortunately, you already tell the person to assign a column, but 
  that is not obvious from the UI.  There needs to be a visual queue to tell the user to assign those
  columns and the rules for how to assign them. Again, this goes back to the readme thing...but maybe
  we're holding off on that...  In the mean time, add some wording above the column assignment
  that directs the user to assign the information where those blank dashes are.  Also, instead of 
  using dashes, have the steps triggered in the headers...
  SOLN: Disable "Check Data" until at least one column is assigned

B19 Why allow people to even look at a 'standardize CAS' option if CAS hasn't even been assigned... 
  What if I didn't even include CAS.  Remove functionalities that are impossible.  
  ... and  Issue: Some functionalities shouldn't show up if they aren't possible.  For example, auto-resolve
  CAS shouldn't show up if that field has not been assigned a CAS.  Also, auto-resolve field shouldn't
  be possible if the data hasn't been checked via the Check Data button (2).

 SOLN: Change menu options to include only possible ones

B21 FEATURE REQUEST:  Allow me to select multiple rows to ignore or w/e I want to do
  SOLN: Turn select multiple back on (Tom turned it off for some crazy reason) - maybe sometimes it should be off?!?

B22 (copied from A3)
  FEATURE REQUEST:  Startup allows user to choose project directory
  SOLN: Have user select a working directory
		include a checkbox: use as default working directory and do not show this dialogue box again


B23 (was A18) BUG:  CASRN should be CAS, Name should be Flowable name in results
  Synonyms should be Flowable Synonyms 
  SOLN: Standardize words, names, etc.  Some of this should be on the object level: avoid duplicating strings in the code.
  STATUS: Used a hack to standardize.  Works for now.
  NEXT: Carefully develop the CSVColumnInfo model so that properties of objects can be defined generally

C1 FEATURE REQUEST:  The 'Match Flowables' panel is completely uncustomizable.  I would want to
  be able to view my data in whatever way I want.  I should at least be able to center the 
  headers in the columns and reorganize the headers to have CASRN first or Synonyms first or 
  w/e... 
  SOLN: Do nothing.  The query can be changed for different output configuration.  Style doesn't matter.

C2 BUG: The border for a lot of windows are interrupted by the minimize and maximize buttons
  SOLN: Consider turning off access to some buttons?!?

C3 BUG: The empty CSV table whitespace doesn't extend the whole window for some reason.
  SOLN: Fix resizing

C4 QUESTION: The TDB files created are messy, shouldn't they be buried a litle bit so the user
  doesn't have to stare at them?
  SOLN: Now in separate folder.  Tell user they don't have to look there.
  
C5 ISSUE: Can hide all of a column when the name should still appear
  SOLN: Perhaps find a minimum size based on text or something - or defined min. for each View

C6 QUESTION:  Should the CSV Table panel give an indication of what imported data is expected?
  I honestly don't what what data I should be giving the thing...
  SOLN: Consider adding info about the Workflow in the workflow window (a tooltip, maybe)
 
C7 ISSUE: Can I only import a CSV or can I import an xls or xlsx file?
  SOLN: No Excel now.  Later? Yes!

C8 QUESTION:  What format should my input file be in?  How will I know if I imported garbage?
  SOLN: Do nothing new.  Garbage data is user's problem

C9 FEATURE REQUEST:  Automatically detect row 1 for column headers
  SOLN: Maybe later.  It would only be a suggestion, and the user could change it.

C10 FEATURE REQUEST:  A dialogue box or something that explains how a search is run and what is required
  SOLN: Document and eventually allow user input for criteria for match

C11 FEATURE REQUEST: Instatiate:  Flowable Resource Object With Name / Synonym (FROWNS) :-(
  SOLN: The world is ready for FROWNS
 
C12 FEATURE REQUEST: Instatiate:  Data unique meta-block system (DUMBS) %^{
  SOLN: The world is ready for DUMBS
  
C13 FEATURE REQUEST:  Minimize std.err std.out output file 
  SOLN: See if there is a way to do this systematically instead of removing every freaking System.out.println("") line!

C14 Need a save button - need something to keep these preferences... Is the log supposed to 
   do this?
  SOLN: Make a system of logging (to tell what happened), and a re-run script created during user run.

A1  BUG: Can't get out of selecting a TDB on install.  An infinite loop of dialogue boxes occurs
  SOLN:  Just fix it.
  STATUS: Done? Now that a default TDB exists on startup, the only option is to change it in preferences, but there *seems* to be no infinite loop
    
A4  ISSUE: No way to tell what version the Harmonization Tool is inside the program (about Harmonization Tool)
  SOLN: Indicate version number (in Help -> About... pull down?!?)
  STATUS: DONE
  
A5  BUG: When "Saving Results" with no input, nothing happens
  SOLN: Just fix it.
  STATUS: Done.  Message appears if the SPARQL Results window is not open or does not contain results.  If cancel pressed, tool behaves.

A6  FEATURE REQUEST: Set some standard perspectives for people to choose from 
  SOLN: Make the menu item do SOMETHING.
